Hi, I am Bryanne Francyne Z. Echevarria, Student from BSIT First Year Section 1A

This is my first file in REPO

about me: I'm a 21 year old irregular student, my former course was BS Architecture in Enverga and BSIT is my second option, I like to spend my time listening to music, and I prefer to do things alone most of the time, I'm a person who is easy to get along with, and I'm mostly considered as a very jolly person.
